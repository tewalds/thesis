\end{figure}

Havannah is a connection game invented in 1979 by Christian Freeling. It is a two player, zero-sum, perfect information game played on a hexagonal board. Each turn a player places a stone on the board in alternating play. Stones are never moved nor removed after their initial placement. A \textit{group} or \textit{chain} is a set of connected stones of the same colour. The game ends when one of the players completes one of the three winning conditions which are shown in Figure \ref{fig:rules}:
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
	\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
	\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
	\item A \textit{Bridge} is a group of stones that connects any 2 corners, for example the stones labelled $\mathcal B$ in Figure \ref{fig:rules}
	\item A \textit{Fork} is a group of stones that connects any 3 edges (corners are not part of either edge), for example the stones labelled $\mathcal F$ in Figure \ref{fig:rules}
	\item A \textit{Ring} is a group of stones that surround at least one cell (which can be empty or filled by either player), for example the stones labelled $\mathcal R$ in Figure \ref{fig:rules}
\end{itemize}

The size of the board is defined as the number of cells along one edge, so the board in Figure \ref{fig:rules} is size 6. Havannah can be played on any size board, but is usually played on board sizes ranging from 4 to 10 cells per side. Stronger players prefer bigger boards due to the larger component of strategy compared to the small boards where tactics dominate. In 2002, Christian Freeling offered \euro 1000 for any program that beats him in just one in ten games on size 10 by 2012.

Havannah is played by a few thousand players around the world, primarily on Little Golem\footnote{\url{http://littlegolem.net}} and similar sites. It is also played by computer programs at the International Computer Games Association games tournaments\footnote{\url{http://www.grappa.univ-lille3.fr/icga/}} yearly.



\section{Coordinate System}

Several coordinate systems exist, but the one that will be used here is the one used in HavannahGui\footnote{\url{http://mgame99.mg.funpic.de/downloads.php}} and in the Little Golem SGF files, because it has some nice mathematical properties\footnote{\url{http://www.iwriteiam.nl/Havannah.html}}. An example board is shown in Figure \ref{fig:coordinatesboard} with each cell marked with its coordinate location. Figure \ref{fig:coordinatessquare} shows the same board as represented on a square grid. The empty points in the square grid are unused for the purposes of this representation. In the square representation connections are valid in the vertical, horizontal and $x=y$ directions, but not in the $x=-y$ direction. This square representation is often used to represent the board in memory. The size of the board is the number of cells along one short edge, or the radius of the board, not the diameter. Given this representation, the distance between any two points can be calculated with $$d = (|x_1-x_2| + |y_1-y_2| + |z_1-z_2|)/2$$

\section{State Space}

A crude overestimation of the number of Havannah states is $T_0(n) = 3^n$ where $n$ is the number of cells on the board. This includes many states that are unreachable purely based on the players having an uneven number of moves, such as all cells being played by player 1. A much more accurate calculation is the sum of states where both players have made equal number of moves plus the sum of all states where player 1 has made one more move. This can be expressed as the formula:
$$T_1(n) = \sum_{i = 0}^{(n-1)/2} {n \choose i}*{n-i \choose i} + {n \choose i + 1}*{n - i - 1 \choose i}$$
These do not take symmetry or rotations into account, which gives approximately a 12 fold reduction in states: $T_2(n) = T_1(n)/12$. None of these approximations take the rules of the game into account, so includes positions where both players have winning formations or one player has multiple winning formations, but this is a much harder condition to approximate.

The state space complexity of Havannah is shown in Figure \ref{table:complexity}, with various other board games listed for comparison. The hex state space size is calculated with the same formula except only two-fold symmetry. By comparison with the games that have previously been solved, size 3 Havannah should be trivial to solve, size 4 should be hard but possible with brute force, and size 5 may be possible but only if strong mathematical properties can be found to dramatically reduce the search space as is done in hex.

\section{Properties of Havannah}

Havannah is considered hard to play for computers for several reasons including the lack of a good heuristic evaluation function, few expert games, and a large state space complexity. It is often compared to Hex, which is also a connection game, but very few of the mathematical properties of  Hex apply in Havannah. In this section I explain some of the properties of Havannah, especially in contrast to the better known properties of Hex.



\subsection{Virtual Connections}

A virtual connection is a connection between two stones or a stone and an edge that can be completed even if the opponent makes the first move. A simple virtual connection is shown in Figure \ref{fig:simplevc}. The two black stones are virtually connected, because if white plays in one of the cells, black can complete the connection by playing in the other. In Hex, virtual connections are guaranteed since there is no reason to not complete the connection, but this is not true in Havannah. In Figure \ref{fig:breakvc}, black has a virtual connection between his two groups, but white can force a defence against a ring threat as shown in Figure \ref{fig:brokenvc}, which allows white to sever the black virtual connection. These threats are rare in practice, but do occur and can't be ignored.

	\label{fig:ringvc}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Frame}

A \textit{frame} is a series of virtually connected stones or chains of stones that if connected would complete a winning condition. The length of the frame is the number of moves needed to complete the winning chain. Several frames are shown in Figure \ref{fig:race}.


\subsection{Simultaneous forced wins: Race to win}

In Hex, winning formations are mutually exclusive, so if one player has a forced win through virtual connections, he is guaranteed to win. This is because the winning conditions are side-to-side VCs which cross, so if one player has a side-to-side VC, the other player cannot also have one.

In Havannah winning formations are not mutually exclusive. Figure \ref{fig:rules} shows 3 completed winning formations at the same time, though this is not a valid board configuration. While virtual connections can be broken, the formations needed to do so are often not present, in which case the virtual connections are guaranteed. Figure \ref{fig:racea} shows a situation where both players have a frame of length 2. This means they can force a win in 2 moves, so the first player to make a move wins. Figure \ref{fig:raceb} shows a situation where both players have a forced win in 3 moves, with black to move. One of white's moves threatens a faster ring victory, which is easily blocked, but which gives white the move advantage and the win, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:racec}.

	\label{fig:race}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Dead Cells}

Strong hex programs reduce the moves under consideration by avoiding playing in dead cells. Dead cells are cells that provably cannot affect the outcome of the game. They are dead because any chain of stones that passes through them already has a path through the existing stones. The five smallest Hex dead cell patterns are shown in Figure \ref{fig:hexdeadcells}. Hex playing programs use these patterns to detect dead cells, then never consider playing in those cells, thereby reducing the branching factor.

\end{HavannahBoard}

\end{tabular}
	\caption{Hex-dead cell patterns: The center of each pattern cannot help either player form a winning connection in Hex.}
	\label{fig:hexdeadcells}
\end{figure}

Unfortunately the hex-dead cell patterns don't apply in Havannah because the hex-dead cells can have an effect on the outcome of Havannah. While they cannot affect a fork or a bridge connection, they can still be part of a winning ring which surrounds one of the existing stones as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:ringdeadcells}. This idea can be used against all 5 of the smallest hex dead cell patterns in numerous ways.

\end{tabular}
	\caption{Starting with the hex-dead cell pattern on the left, and adding stones 1-4 leads to the ring on the right which intersects the hex-dead cell pattern}
	\label{fig:ringdeadcells}
\end{figure}

Note that if the ring is made bigger than a simple 6-ring, any ring that uses the dead cell would also work going around it, so to create Havannah dead cell patterns, we add a stone of the opposing colour next to each existing stone to block the encircling 6-ring. A few examples are shown in Figure \ref{fig:havdeadcells}. Unfortunately these patterns are so rare that they aren't worth looking for.

\subsection{Draws}

Unlike Hex where a filled board must have a winner, draws are possible in Havannah. Figure \ref{fig:drawfilled} shows a filled board of the game that ended in a draw. Backing up a few moves we see in Figure \ref{fig:drawnowin} that after move 30 no wins are possible even if one of the players were to pass all their remaining moves. Figure \ref{fig:drawproven} is the same board after move 20, where the game is already a proven draw. Draws are possible on all board sizes above 3. They occur occasionally on size 4 and but are very rare on size 5 and above.

	\label{fig:draw}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Multiple and Complex Win Conditions}

The rules of Havannah are quite simple, and the three win conditions are easy to describe, but they are not simple to reason about.

Both bridges and forks can be found in near O(1) with the union find algorithm and bit counting. Each stone placed on a corner or edge has a bit associated with that corner or edge, and as stones form chains, the leader of the group ORs together the bits for all the corners and edges the group is connected to. Once the group reaches two corners or three edges, that group forms a win condition.

For a simple implementation, this works well, but humans think in terms of frames and spend a fair amount of time and effort building frames and counting how many moves a frame will take to complete. If the goal is to understand how long a frame will take to complete, the possible frames must be enumerated. In that case, there are ${6 \choose 2} = 15$ possible bridge wins and ${6 \choose 3} = 20$ possible fork wins, which must be considered independently.

There are many more ways for rings and ring frames to occur, and rings are much tougher to detect. One obvious way to detect rings is to flood fill the board and look for unreachable areas. This method is not an incremental algorithm, so ignores the assertion from previous moves that there are no rings, and is very slow. There are two incremental approaches, both of which are fast.

The first is to do a depth-first search starting from the most recently placed stone, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:dfring}. The search is only started if the group is at least 6 stones, and if the last stone joins one group of stones twice. From the starting stone, it searches in 4 adjacent directions (4 is enough because any ring must start from one of the four directions even if it cycles back through the other two), continuing only in the forward direction to the next 3 stones. By avoiding any sharp turns, the minimum cycle is 6 and any path back to the starting stone is a ring. This method does have a fairly bad worst case, but is very fast in practice because the ring check can be skipped after most moves. It has the advantage that the size of the ring can be found by counting the number of steps to reach a previously reached stone.

Ring detection can be also be done in O(1) time as shown in Figure \ref{fig:o1ring}. Rings occur when the most recently placed stone touches the same group twice with them being separated on both sides by empty space or the opponents pieces. The only circumstance where that isn't true is a filled 6-ring, which can only happen in a small number of ways and is easy to detect. Figure \ref{fig:o1ringa} shows the common case where a stone joins a group twice and has empty space in the middle of the ring and on the opposite side. If the center of the ring is filled, as is the case in Figure \ref{fig:o1ringb}, a check of the neighbours is enough to deduce that it might be a ring, but the remaining three cells must be checked to conclude it is a ring. The reason no bigger search is needed is because any bigger ring that passes through the newly placed stone would already be a ring passing through the existing stones and therefore would have been found earlier. The worst case, shown in Figure \ref{fig:o1ringd} is when the stone has 5 adjacent neighbours, in which case 3 searches for 6-rings are needed. This method is very fast in general, but does need to be done before joining the groups for the edge/corner checking. Doing the check before placing the stone likely means the conditions that allow the depth-first method to be skipped aren't known to be satisfied, meaning the check must be done for every move.
